# Protocol and fixed values

Both repositories implement these contracts. Change them only in the agentwatch plan.

- Sender extension ID: `bpfkgknpndlpkcffmaaelkfcbpackiip`
- Receiver extension ID: `dofdpnfachcncepdoondkeodcbnhipdc`

### C1. Names and IDs

- Native messaging host name: `sh.agentwatch.browser`.
- Extension IDs: fixed by the manifest `key` of each extension. Task E1 generates two fresh RSA-2048
  keys (the private key goes through a pipe and is never written), puts the base64 DER public key into
  each manifest, computes each ID (SHA-256 of the DER, first 32 hex digits, `0-9a-f` -> `a-p`) and
  records both IDs in `docs/protocol.md`. Task A1 copies them into `tools/pins.py`.

### C2. The send payload (sender -> gateway -> daemon -> receiver)

UTF-8 JSON, at most 33,554,432 bytes:

```json
{"v": 1, "domain": "example.com", "url": "https://www.example.com/app?x=1",
 "origin": "https://www.example.com",
 "cookies": [{"name": "", "value": "", "domain": "", "hostOnly": true, "path": "/", "secure": true,
              "httpOnly": true, "sameSite": "lax", "session": false, "expirationDate": 1.0,
              "partitionKey": {"topLevelSite": "https://example.com", "hasCrossSiteAncestor": false}}],
 "storage": {"local": {"k": "v"}, "session": {"k": "v"},
             "idb": [{"name": "db", "version": 3, "stores": [{"name": "s", "keyPath": null,
                      "autoIncrement": false, "indexes": [{"name": "i", "keyPath": "a",
                      "unique": false, "multiEntry": true}],
                      "records": [{"key": {"t": "j", "v": 1}, "value": {"t": "obj", "v": {}}}]}]}],
             "caches": [{"name": "c", "entries": [{"url": "https://www.example.com/x", "status": 200,
                         "headers": [["content-type", "text/plain"]], "body": "<base64>"}]}]}}
```

Validity (the sender builds only valid payloads; the daemon refuses others with
`browser_payload_invalid`, naming the field, never a value):

- `v` is 1. `domain` is a normalized allowlist entry (C5 rules). `origin` is `http:` or `https:`, has
  no path, and its host is covered by `domain`. `url` parses and has exactly that origin.
- Each cookie has string `name`, `value`, `domain`, `path`, booleans `hostOnly`, `secure`, `httpOnly`,
  `session`, `sameSite` in `no_restriction|lax|strict|unspecified`, a number `expirationDate` when
  `session` is false, an optional `partitionKey`; its domain without a leading dot is covered by
  `domain`.
- `storage.local` and `storage.session` map strings to strings. `idb` and `caches` have the shapes
  above; `keyPath` is `null`, a string or a list of strings.

### C3. The tagged value encoding (`codec.js`, the probe's `enc`/`dec` plus three fixes)

`{"t":"undef"}`, `{"t":"j","v":<null|boolean|string|finite number other than -0>}`,
`{"t":"num","v":"NaN"|"Infinity"|"-Infinity"|"-0"}`, `{"t":"big","v":"<decimal>"}`,
`{"t":"date","v":<ms or null for an invalid Date>}`,
`{"t":"blob","type":"","v":"<b64>"}` and for a `File` also `"name"` and `"lastModified"`,
`{"t":"ab","v":"<b64>"}`, `{"t":"view","c":"<constructor name>","v":"<b64>"}`,
`{"t":"map","v":[[<enc>,<enc>]]}`, `{"t":"set","v":[<enc>]}`, `{"t":"arr","v":[<enc>]}` (a hole is
`undef`), `{"t":"re","s":"","f":""}`, `{"t":"obj","v":{"key":<enc>}}`,
`{"t":"unsupported","c":"<constructor name>"}`.
The fixes over the probe: `-0` survives; an object key `__proto__` is decoded with
`Object.defineProperty`, never by assignment; `unsupported` carries no value and decoding it throws
`UnsupportedValue`.

### C4. Daemon <-> receiver messages

One JSON object per native message. On the daemon's socket each message is one NDJSON line.

- receiver -> daemon: `{"t":"hello","v":1,"version":"<manifest version>"}`;
  `{"t":"res","id":"<id>","ok":true,"data":{...}}` or `{"t":"res","id":"<id>","ok":false,"error":"<text>"}`;
  `{"t":"blocked","tab":<tab id>,"host":"<host>"}`.
- native host -> receiver: `{"t":"link","up":true}` after each connect to the daemon socket (the
  receiver answers with `hello`).
- daemon -> receiver: only parts, `{"t":"part","id":"<id>","seq":<i>,"n":<count>,"b64":"<base64>"}`.
  The daemon serializes the request as compact UTF-8 JSON, cuts the bytes into slices of
  `PART_BYTES = 700000` (the last slice may be shorter; an empty request is never sent), and sends
  slice `i` base64-encoded with `seq = i`, `n` = the slice count. The receiver joins the decoded slices
  of one `id` in `seq` order once all `n` arrived, decodes UTF-8 and parses the request. Parts of
  different ids may not interleave (the daemon sends one request at a time); a part with a new `id`
  drops an unfinished one.
- Requests: `{"t":"req","id":"<id>","op":"ping"}` -> `{}`;
  `{"t":"req","id":"<id>","op":"set_allowlist","domains":["a.example"]}` ->
  `{"rules":<1 if the list is not empty, else 0>,"closed":<tabs closed>}`;
  `{"t":"req","id":"<id>","op":"import","state":<C2 payload>}` ->
  `{"cookies_removed":0,"cookies_set":0,"tabs_closed":0,"local":0,"session":0,"idb_databases":0,"idb_records":0,"cache_entries":0,"errors":["<store or cookie name>: <reason>"]}`.
- Ids are strings. The daemon waits 10 s for `ping` and `set_allowlist`, 120 s for `import`.

### C5. The allowlist and the block

- File `CONFIG_DIR/browser/allowlist.json` = `{"allow": ["example.com", ...]}` (agent-browser's
  format; the daemon writes it with `statefiles.write_json`).
- An entry is a hostname: trimmed, lowercased, a trailing dot removed, Unicode labels to punycode
  (IDNA), at least two labels, each label 1-63 of `[a-z0-9-]` not starting or ending with `-`, total at
  most 253; no scheme, port, path, `*` or IP address. A pasted URL is refused with the hint "paste the
  host only" (the web viewer strips a URL to its host before it sends). An entry covers itself and
  every subdomain (O10).
- Before parsing, an entry is refused when it holds an ASCII character outside `[A-Za-z0-9.-]`, a
  character of Unicode category C (control, format, unassigned, private use), one of the dots U+3002,
  U+FF0E, U+FF61, or `ß` (U+00DF) or `ς` (U+03C2) ("use the punycode form": JavaScript's URL and
  Python's IDNA map these differently). After IDNA the entry matches `^[a-z0-9.-]+$`. A refusal
  reason never echoes the input; an empty label says "a label is empty".
- DNR: the receiver's static ruleset `block_main_frame` (`rules/block-main-frame.json`, enabled in the
  manifest): rule id 1, priority 1, `{"type":"block"}`, `resourceTypes: ["main_frame"]`. One dynamic
  rule id 2, priority 2, `{"type":"allow"}`, `requestDomains` = the list, `resourceTypes:
  ["main_frame"]`; no rule 2 when the list is empty. So the block holds from Chromium's first moment,
  before the service worker runs.
- On each `set_allowlist` the receiver closes every tab whose `http:`/`https:` host the new list does
  not cover; if that would close the last tab of a window, it first opens `about:blank` there.
- A main-frame `webNavigation.onErrorOccurred` with `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` sends `blocked` with
  the host only.

### C6. The restore page (the receiver's import)

1. (Measured: a partitioned cookie of an http secure-context test site, `*.localhost`, does not move
   with this URL rule; https sites are not affected.) Remove every cookie of `domain` and its subdomains (`getAll({domain})` and
   `getAll({domain, partitionKey: {}})`), then `cookies.set` each sent cookie (C2 -> set details:
   `url` = `https://` if secure else `http://`, the domain without a leading dot, the path; `domain`
   only when not `hostOnly`; `expirationDate` only when not `session`; `sameSite` and `partitionKey` as
   sent).
2. Close every tab whose origin equals `origin` (they hold the state being replaced; the about:blank
   guard of C5 applies), then `tabs.create({url: "about:blank", active: true})`,
   `debugger.attach({tabId}, "1.3")`, `Network.setBypassServiceWorker({bypass: true})`,
   `Fetch.enable({patterns: [{urlPattern: R, requestStage: "Request"}]})` with
   `R = origin + "/__agentwatch_restore_" + <16 hex chars> + "__"`, `tabs.update(tabId, {url: R})`;
   on `Fetch.requestPaused` for `R`: `Fetch.fulfillRequest` 200, headers `Content-Type: text/html;
   charset=utf-8` and `Cache-Control: no-store`, body
   `<!doctype html><meta charset="utf-8"><link rel="icon" href="data:,"><title>agentwatch</title>`.
3. After `webNavigation.onCompleted` for `R` in that tab: `executeScript({files: ["lib/codec.js"]})`,
   then `executeScript({func: replacePageState, args: [JSON.stringify(state.storage)]})`
   (one JSON string: `executeScript` drops null-valued properties). `replacePageState` clears
   localStorage, sessionStorage, every IndexedDB database of the origin and every cache, then writes
   the sent ones, and returns counts and errors. It first checks that it runs on the restore page
   (title "agentwatch", no script elements, `location.href === R`) and else touches nothing.
4. `Fetch.disable`, `debugger.detach`, then `executeScript({func: (u) => location.replace(u), args:
   [state.url]})`.
5. Any step that fails: detach, close the restore tab, answer `ok: false` with the step's name. Each
   step has a 20 s deadline. One import at a time; a second waits.

### C9. The two gateway routes, as the sender sees them

The sender calls only these two routes, on the web viewer origin of a box that the operator
added (the sender holds a host permission for it). Both carry the operator's web login cookie
(`credentials: "include"`). The gateway sends no CORS headers: the host permission makes the
answer readable.

| Route | What the sender sends | What the sender reads |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/browser/targets` | No body. Chromium sends **no `Origin`** on this GET (`Sec-Fetch-Site: none`; measured on Chromium 156, 2026-11-01). | 200: `{"box": "<host>", "users": [{"name", "supported", "running", "password_login": bool}]}`, also inside `{"ok": true, "data": ...}`. The popup offers only users with `password_login: true`. 401 or 403: "Log in to <box> first." |
| `POST /api/browser/send?user=<name>` | The C2 JSON, `Content-Type: application/json`, at most 33,554,432 bytes (a larger state is refused in the sender, naming the largest database). Chromium sends `Origin: chrome-extension://bpfkgknpndlpkcffmaaelkfcbpackiip`. | 200: the C4 import counts at `data.counts` (also `counts`, `data` or the top level). 403 with `error_code` `password_login_required`: log in with a password. 401: log in. 413: too large. 409 `browser_unsupported`: no agent browser on that box. Any other status: refused. |

The gateway's check (EXTENSION auth): any `Authorization` header gives 403. A GET or HEAD needs no
`Origin`, but any `Origin` other than `chrome-extension://<sender ID>` gives 403. A POST needs that
exact `Origin`, else 403. Then the login cookie session, else 401. A login without
`password_login_for` gives 403 `{"error_code": "password_login_required"}`.
